Because chromeOS is too terribleTM

## What is this?
Schools like to manage devices. Lots of schools use Chromebooks.
However, what if they used a *real* Linux distro?
Introducing MDMForManjaro, so that schools get their management, and students get a superior OS.
(Anything except for Windows 8.1 or newer is superior to chromeOS)
